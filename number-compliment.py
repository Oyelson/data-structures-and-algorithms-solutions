Problem:
    Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
    The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.


Example 1:
    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
        The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
        and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
    Input: 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation:
        The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits),
        and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

Note:
    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
    integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation
    This question is the same as 1009:

Explanation:
    We are going to consider a pattern.

    let num = n
    let compliment = c

    n   | n in base 2 | flip base | c
 -----------------------------------------
    1   |           1 |         0 | 0
    2   |          10 |         1 | 1
    3   |          11 |         0 | 0
    4   |         100 |        11 | 3
    5   |         101 |        10 | 2
    6   |         110 |         1 | 1
    7   |         111 |         0 | 0
    8   |        1000 |       111 | 7
    9   |        1001 |       110 | 6
   10   |        1010 |       101 | 5
   11   |        1011 |       100 | 4
   12   |        1100 |        11 | 3

   Using some cases:
       also, let p be the maximum power of 2 you can get from n
       and let c be the compliment of n.

    n  |      n in powers of  2     | c |  c in powers of 2

   Hence the compliment of n, c = (2*2^p) - (n+1);
