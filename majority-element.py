Problem:
    Given an array of size n, find the majority element.
    The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

    You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always
    exist in the array.

Example 1:
    Input: [3,2,3]
    Output: 3

Example 2:
    Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
    Output: 2

    num_dict = {}
