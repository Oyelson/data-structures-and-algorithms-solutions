Problem:
    Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits
    from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
    The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
    The given num does not contain any leading zero.

Example 1:
    Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
    Output: "1219"
    Explanation:
        Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which
        is the smallest.

Example 2:
    Input: num = "10200", k = 1
    Output: "200"
    Explanation:
        Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must
        not contain leading zeroes.

Example 3:
    Input: num = "10", k = 2
    Output: "0"
    Explanation:
        Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which
        is 0.
