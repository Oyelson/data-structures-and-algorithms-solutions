 Initial 15 minutes resume and experience. Then, one technical question on coderpad:

Given an int n. You can use only 2 operations:

multiply by 2
integer division by 3 (e.g. 10 / 3 = 3)
Find the minimum number of steps required to generate n from 1.

Example 1:
Input: 10
Output: 6
Explanation: 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 / 3 * 2
6 steps required, as we have used 5 multiplications by 2, and one division by 3.


Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 / 3 / 3
7 steps required, as we have used 5 multiplications by 2 and 2 divisions by 3

                                             *2 /    \ \3
                                              2       0 (F)
                                          *2 /  \ \3
                                           4     0 (F)
                                       *2 /  \ \3
