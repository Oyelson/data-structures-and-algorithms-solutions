Problem:
    Invert a binary tree.

Example:
    Input:

         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   / \
    1   3 6   9

    Output:

        4
       /   \
      7     2
     / \   / \
    9   6 3   1

Trivia:
    This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

Google:
    90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew),
    but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
